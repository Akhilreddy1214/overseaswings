                    <h4 class=" py-1" > What is the procedure to study in Canada?</h4>

                    <p>The first step is to get admission to a Canadian Designated Learning Institution (DLI) recognized by the government of Canada. Once an individual receives a letter of acceptance from a DLI, he or she may be able to apply for a study permit. Applications may be made online or by mail.</p>


                    <p>All new study permits are issued at a Canadian port of entry. An applicant who has submitted an application to a foreign Canadian Visa Office will be issued a letter of approval advising him or her to travel to a Canadian port of entry to have the study permit issued. A study permit is generally issued for the duration of the person’s studies.</p>

                    <h5> How much does it cost to study in Canada?</h5>
                    <p>Tuition fees vary based on institution. Please contact the administration where you intend to study for more information.</p>


                    <h5> Do I need to show proof of funds when applying for a study permit?</h5>
                    <p>Canada study permit applicants need to prove they have sufficient funds to cover tuition fees, and financial capacity to support living expenses for the first year of study.  This table shows minimum funds required to support yourself as a student and family members who come with you to Canada:</p>
                    <p >1. Number of people All provinces except Quebec</p>
                    <p >2. Single student Tuition plus $10,000 for a 12-month period (or $833 per month)</p>
                    <p >3. For one accompanying family member add: $4,000 for a 12-month period (or $333 per month)</p>
                    <p >4. For each additional family member, add: $3,000 for a 12-month period per dependent child of any age (or $255 per month)</p>
                    <p >5. In Quebec, the financial requirements for prospective students are different. In addition to tuition fees, a prospective international student is required to show that he or she has the following funds, dependent on his or her situation.</p>

                    <h5>     What are the eligiblility criteria for Study Permits?</h5>
                    <p > To obtain a study permit, you must have a valid acceptance letter issued by a DLI in Canada. Other eligibility requirements include:</p>
                    <p >1. A valid passport or other lawful travel document.</p>
                    <p >2. Adequate financial resources to pay fees charged by the educational institution, meet expenses for stay of student and accompanying family member(s) in Canada, and to meet the cost of return transportation for student and accompanying family member(s) after completion of the course.</p>
                    <p > 3. Good health and fitness. You, and your accompanying family, may be required to obtain a medical certificate issued after a complete medical exam. Only residents of certain countries are required to undergo a medical examination.</p>
                    <p >4. Demonstrate that you are not a risk to Canadian society and have a clean criminal record as evidenced through a valid police certificate.</p>
                    <p >5. The medical and character requirements apply to all family members accompanying the student.</p>
                    
                    
                    <h5>Are Study Permits required for all courses in Canada?  </h5>
       <p>You don’t need a study permit if the course or program you plan to join is of less than six months duration. Since a tourist visa is normally issued with a validity of six months, the study permit requirement is waived for courses of a shorter duration. However, a permit will be required if the program is a part of a longer course or if the visitor will have to extend his/her stay in Canada in order to complete the course.</p>

       <h5>     Can a Study Permit Holder work in canada? </h5>
       <p>       Yes. A study permit holder is allowed to on a part-time basis without applying for a work permit, as specified on the study permit. Such a student must have a valid Social Insurance Number (SIN). The right to work when holding a study permit ceases when the study permit expires or when the student stops attending the full-time course.</p>
   

       <h5> Can a student switch between Institutions with the same Study Permit? </h5>
       <p>Unless it is specified on your study permit, any change in your field of study or educational institution in Canada doesn’t require applying for a new study permit. What that means is that high school and post-secondary students can switch between institutions and do NOT have to apply for a new permit. However, a move involving a change of status—a primary school student moving on to high school or a high school student enrolling into a post-secondary educational institution—can be done only after modifying the study permit. In the case that a study permit specifies the institution/field of study, any changes in program or institution must be modified before the permit holder can join a new course or school. Quebec requires students to apply for a fresh CAQ and, if required, a new study permit before switching from one institution to another.</p>
       
       
       <h5>  Can Spouse and Children Accompany the Study Permit Holder? </h5>
       <p>Yes. A full-time student can be accompanied by his/her spouse and children to Canada. The spouse can study or work if they obtain a study permit or spousal open work permit respectively. Accompanying children attending pre-school, primary, or secondary school can study in Canada without requiring a separate study permit. However, children attending a post-secondary educational institution must apply for their own valid study permit.</p>
      
       
       <h5>  What is the Validity period of a Study Permit? </h5>
       <p>The study permit is valid throughout the duration of your study program. It will remain valid for an additional 90 days following the end of the program. The student must make preparations to either leave Canada or extend his/her legal stay within this period.</p>
      
       
       <h5>  How can a Study Permit Holder Stay in Canada after Completing the Course/Program?</h5>
       <p>Foreign graduates from Canadian DLI’s can apply an open work permit under the Post-Graduation Work Permit program.
